# Destroy My Journal

I want to write journal entries without the risk of other people being able to somehow see it. This is a web application being developed to allow me (or anyone) to fully flesh out and write a journal entry, letter, or other piece of writing and then destroy it, without it being saved anywhere, while still being a satisfying and fulfulling (and perhaps slightly melodramatic) journaling experience.

This is a work in progress. Began on May 9, 2023
